Security Review: HTTPS and Secure Redirects
Implemented Security Measures
    1. Enforced HTTPS
        Enabled SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True to force HTTPS.
        Configured SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000 to enforce HTTPS at the browser level.
    
    2. Secured Cookies
        Enabled SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True and CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True to prevent data transmission over HTTP.
    3. Secured HTTP Headers
        Set X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY" to prevent clickjacking.
        Enabled SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True to mitigate XSS risks.
    4. Deployment Configuration
        Updated Nginx configuration to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
        Set up SSL certificates using Letâ€™s Encrypt.
    5. Next Steps
        Perform security testing using curl -I https://yourdomain.com.
        Regularly update SSL certificates to avoid expiration.
